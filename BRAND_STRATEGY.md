# Nimara Brand Strategy

> Last updated: January 2026

---

## Brand Positioning

**Tagline**: Funder-Ready Systems for Canadian Nonprofits

**Core Position**: Nimara is a **systems and standards specialist** that helps Canadian nonprofits build operational infrastructure — not strategy consulting, not software sales — so organizations are ready when funders ask questions.

**Differentiation**: We build tangible assets (policies, templates, trackers, workflows) within your existing tools. No "rip-and-replace." No new software to learn.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: Small-to-Mid Size Canadian Nonprofits
- **Staff size**: 1-15 employees (cohort focus) up to 100 (general services)
- **Stage**: Established enough that audits, funders, HR, and compliance are real pain points
- **Pain**: Scrambling when funders ask for policies, reports, or proof
- **Not a fit**: Very early-stage orgs without stable staff or just an idea

### Secondary: Nonprofit Consultants
- Independent consultants seeking structured project work
- Operators who want to join the Nimara Partner Network

---

## Value Proposition

### The Promise
> "When funders ask for policies, reports, or audits — you'll have them ready."

### Core Benefit
Build funder-ready systems so funding is easier to win and manage.

### Key Outcomes
1. **Funder-Ready** — Grant applications backed by documented systems
2. **Audit-Ready** — Policies and proof trails in place before auditors ask
3. **Report-Ready** — Data organized for impact reporting
4. **Board-Ready** — Governance documentation funders expect
5. **Grant-Ready** — Operational capacity to manage funding properly

## Design Language

### Philosophy: Premium Editorial Minimalism
Explicitly reject common AI/SaaS design patterns. No:
- Overused gradients
- Decorative orbs or particles
- Generic icons or emoji
- Purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts

### Visual Identity
- **Primary palette**: Dark navy (#0f1629, #0B1120, #0a0f1a)
- **Secondary**: Off-white/cloud (#f0efec, nim-cloud)
- **Accent**: Mint (#ACFCE3) for Path A, Purple (#6945D8) for Path B/CTAs
- **Typography**: DM Sans (primary), bold headlines with tight tracking
- **Layout**: Asymmetric grids, massive whitespace (140px+ padding)

### Typography Standards
- **Headlines**: font-extrabold, tracking-[-0.03em], leading-[1.05]
- **Scale**: Mobile 2.25rem → Desktop 6.5rem+
- **Style**: Numbered indicators over icons, italic accents for key terms

### Component Patterns
- Glassmorphic cards on dark backgrounds
- White cards as focal points for key conversion elements
- Numbered lists over bullet points
- Subtle fade animations (no aggressive motion)

---

## Messaging Framework

### Hero Rotating Words
Cycle through: Funder-Ready → Audit-Ready → Report-Ready → Board-Ready → Grant-Ready

### Section Labels
- Use uppercase tracking labels (e.g., "AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, YOU GET")
- Numbered sections (01, 02, 03) for editorial feel

### Tone
- **Reading level**: Grade 5-6 (accessible, not dumbed down)
- **Voice**: Confident, direct, professional
- **Avoid**: Jargon, buzzwords, startup-speak, "AI-generated" feel

### Key Phrases
- "Funder-ready systems"
- "When funders ask, you'll have it ready"
- "No new software"
- "Works with the tools you already use"
- "It has to work"
